## Dungeon and Dragons Spell Tracker

### `Classes`

The sidebar on the left lets you filter spells in the middle by classes. This will also alter the right-hand spellbook to help track spell slots for the corresponding class.

### `Spell List`

The spell list in the left-middle shows all available spells according to the class chosen. This can be filtered further by parameters in the form above it. Spells can be expanded to show more information and added to the spellbook on the right using the '+' icon.

### `Spellbook`

On right side, a spell book tracks spells added from the spell list along with the spell slots available according the chosen class and level. Spells can be "casted" from this menu by expanding the spell tab and selecting "Cast". The spell slot menu will keep track of spent slots and can be refreshed with the "Rest" button. 

Classes that need to prepare spells before will be given the option to keep spells between rests or prepare new ones from the spell list.
